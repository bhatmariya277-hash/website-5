        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Islam in Kashmir developed over centuries through trade, missionaries, political change, and cultural exchange. This site summarizes the main phases: early contacts, the influential role of Sufi saints, the formation of Muslim dynasties, and later imperial rules that shaped Kashmir's society and culture.</p>

      <section id="arrival" class="arrival container">
        <h2>How Islam Arrived</h2>
        <p>Early contacts between Kashmir and the Islamic world began via trade and travelers from Central Asia and Persia. The major spread of Islam in Kashmir occurred between the 13th and 15th centuries, led by Sufi missionaries who combined religious teaching with social and economic engagement. Conversion often followed from the work of saints who introduced new crafts, agricultural techniques, and social institutions.</p>

            <h3>Mughal Period (1586–1752)</h3>

            <h3>Afghan Rule (1752–1819)</h3>

            <h3>Sikh and Dogra Periods (1819–1947)</h3>
            <p>Ranjit Singh's Sikh empire took Kashmir in 1819; shortly after, in 1846, the region came under Dogra rule following the Treaty of Amritsar. The Dogra era modernized some institutions but also entrenched new political structures that lasted into the 20th century.</p>

        <h2>Sufi Saints and Cultural Change</h2>
        <p>Sufi figures played a central role in spreading Islam through preaching, poetry, and social reform. The most famous is Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani (Shah-e-Hamadan), a 14th-century Persian scholar whose followers helped develop crafts (such as shawl weaving) and religious institutions across Kashmir.</p>

        <h2>Cultural Impact</h2>
        <p>The arrival of Islam brought changes in religious practices, law, and social organization, while local traditions persisted and adapted. Kashmir developed a distinctive syncretic culture expressed in language, poetry (notably Persian and later Kashmiri), music, and crafts.</p>
